## Project Overview 

Dinoworld is an adventure based discovery about the different types of dinosaurs that have existed around the globe highlighting the characteristics of each individual dinosaurs along with the types of diet and what percentage of them eat based on their species. This webapp provides a great **all-in-one** learning tool for people of all ages and develops the knowledge and history you need to know about the dinosaurs.

## Key Features

* List of 100 dinosaurs with key characteristics and description.
* A search bar for filtering out specific dinosaurs among the list.
* A pie chart depicting the percentage of dinosaurs diet (herbivorous, carnivorous, omnivorous).
* An interactive map page showcasing all the dinosaurs found in different countries, continents, and cities around the world.

## Web App Development

### [HTML](#html)

- **HTML File (index.html)**
  
  - Defines the structure of the webpage.
  - Includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
  - Contains elements such as header, main content, footer, and sections for hero, cards, and charts.
  - Includes placeholders for dynamic content such as card data.

### [CSS](#css)

- **CSS File (style.css)**
  
  - Defines the visual appearance of the webpage.
  - Includes styles for various sections such as header, hero section, card section, chart section, and footer.
  - Sets colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual properties.
  - Implements responsive design using media queries (@media rules).
  - Defines animations or transitions for interactive elements.

### [JavaScript](#javascript)

- **JavaScript File (app.js)**
  
  - Fetches data from a JSON file asynchronously (fetchData() function).
  - Dynamically renders cards based on the fetched data (displayCards() function).
  - Implements a "show more" functionality for the cards (loadMoreCards() function).
  - Toggles the visibility of the "Show More" button based on the number of cards displayed (toggleShowMoreButton() function).
  - Creates HTML elements for each card based on the provided data (createCardElement(card) function).
  - Implements event listeners for toggling card details visibility and loading more cards.

### [Figma](#figma)

- UI Design: Designing the user interface elements such as headers, navigation bars, cards, buttons, etc., as well as defining the overall layout and visual style of the webpage.
- Prototyping: Creating interactive prototypes to demonstrate the functionality and flow of the webpage, including transitions between different states and screens.
- Collaboration: Allowing team members, including designers, developers, and stakeholders, to collaborate on the design project, provide feedback, and iterate on the design until it meets the project requirements.

Each file contributes to different aspects of the webpage, collectively creating the user interface, functionality, and visual design. Overall, Figma serves as a comprehensive tool for designing, prototyping, and collaborating on digital projects, making it a valuable asset in the development process of websites and applications.
